# Python
All concepts of Python (Basic To Advanced)

沽灰ata containers : 
1) Lists -  a list is a collection of elements, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas.
2) Tuples - collection of elements, enclosed in () and seperated by commas again (immutable- cant add and remove elements).
3) Sets -  mutable collection of data, does not allow any duplicate element enclosed within {}.
4) Dictionaries - used to mapping some value to user defined index where the index is unique

沽灰ata types :
1) Strings - data type that represents characters within quotes.
2) Integers - This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals).
3) Float - This value is represented by the float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point.

沽蟹nbuilt functions:
round, min, max, map, sum, etc

沽海onditional statements:
if - Here if the condition is true run the block of code below it and if the condition is false dont run the code block and move on the next line of code in the program
if-else - These are bi-conditional statements where you provide the if statement along with else i.e for false in if condition it will run the else block and then continue the program
if-elif-else - These are used for multi conditional statements(more than two conditions to check)
nested conditional statements - if the first condition is true check which nested condition is true in those conditions

沽貝oops:
1)for - used to iterate through a collection(data containers) of any datatypes.
2)while - used to iterate through the block of code till given condition is unsatisfied (doesn't need loops to run through , if statements run only once here it is a loop until its satisfied)
3)break - used in for loops to break the loop when a condition is satisfied making it funciton like a while loop but here we can have multiple conditions to end the loop functions the same in while loop too
4)continue - used in break the where satisfies condition and continue running the loop till it ends by itself

沽皆unctions :
1) user defined set of code used to run some operations given in it multiple times as per requirement.

沽凱odules:
functions written by others and can be used when imported are modules/packages.
math, os, colorama
pip installation of packages

沽界xception Handling:
1) User defined Errors, Error that support the program logic made by programmer and continues to run the program after running the exception block code where as when dont handle the error it stops the program over there .
2) Handling Built-In Errors in Python

沽皆ile Handling
 Can handle and manipulate files using file handling and do not have to manually create files and clt-c clt-v the data obtained here.

 沽外OPs Concepts in Python
窶イlass - class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.
窶グbjects - initiating class and calling its methods
窶オnheritance - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. 
窶ケolymorphism - It simply means having many forms.(Similar as overriding)
窶ウncapsulation - Encapsulation puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
